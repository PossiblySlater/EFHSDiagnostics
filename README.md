# EFHSDiagnostics

EFHSDiagnostics is a desktop application for quickly assessing the health and performance of your computer, made to be easy for students to use. Built with Electron, it provides a fast, user-friendly graphical interface to view detailed hardware and system diagnosticsâ€”all in one place.

**Made by students, for students:** EFHSDiagnostics is designed specifically with middle and high school computer technicians in mind. Our goal is to make it easy for students to see everything about a computer in one place, providing all the essential diagnostics and system information through a simple, unified interface.
